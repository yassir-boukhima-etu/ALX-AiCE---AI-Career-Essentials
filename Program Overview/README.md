## AICE Program At A Glance (Part 1)

This course is about supercharging YOU, as a professional, to become maximally effective and highly valuable in practically any work situation. The image below shows how we intend to do this.

![image](/Program%20Overview/image/part1.png)

The AICE program is developed to elevate you to a higher level of competence in 2 key areas that research shows are **VERY** important to your success: **critical workplace skills** (which we also refer to as soft skills) and **AI literacy**. Additionally, to elevate your productivity in the workplace, you will also learn some **workplace tech tools**.It’s important you develop both your **workplace skills** and your competency with **AI tools** to give yourself the best possible boost to your career.

So don’t be surprised when you are presented with one module that focuses on workplace skills like effective communication with colleagues, and then the next module is on a powerful AI tool or a workplace tech tool. Doing this_ (moving back and forth between different skills) is called interleaving, _and it’s a very effective way to learn and grow.

## AICE Program At A Glance (Part 2)

We know AI tools can have astounding features and capabilities, but we believe true success lies in the combination of both soft skills and the ability to leverage AI effectively. And you will develop the ability to do this well in just 6 action-packed weeks! It will require considerable effort and perseverance on your part, but we’ll guide you every step of the way.

To give you a heads up, when you see this **image**, know you are about to go through content that helps develop your workplace/soft skills:

While this **image** indicates that you are about to learn about AI-related tools:

And, this image indicates the module focuses on **Workplace Tech Tools**:

We trust your abilities and know that by the end of this 6 weeks program, you will have developed skills to help you truly stand out in your workplace!

## Why Complete The ALX AICE Program?

The **AiCE program** is designed to provide essential **AI literacy** needed to boost your career as an **early-career professional. This program provides you with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in any role in the current job market**. Additionally, it gives you a competitive edge by offering you the “ALX Special Sauce” - a distinctive combination of knowledge, skill sets, and character qualities highly desired by employers but not often taught in most training programs.

Our “Special Sauce” consists of 8 **AI-infused Meta Skills** that were informed by research conducted by the AL Group team, which included interviewing over 200 executives across Africa and around the world to discover the answer to one key question:

**“What are the most important skills entry-level employees must have when they work for your company?”**

The 8 Meta Skills are:

We also found that these skill sets are in agreement and align with two key articles that spell out what professionals need to thrive in this ever-evolving, AI-led world of work.

We invite you to read these 2 articles that should convince you even further how valuable these skills are! As you go through these articles, try to answer the following questions;

- According to McKinsey, how many foundational skills will benefit all citizens?
- What are the 4 skills categories according to McKinsey?
- According to Fred Swaniker what are the two major inflection points with respect to AI when it comes to education?

Article 1 is a [research by McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/defining-the-skills-citizens-will-need-in-the-future-world-of-work?cid=other-soc-lkn-mps-mck-oth-2106--&sid=8452174334&linkId=194255334) that defines key 21st-century skills for professionals.

Article 2 is a [LinkedIn article by Fred Swaniker](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/education-time-ai-6-shifts-world-needs-make-fred-swaniker/), highlighting the AI disruption and the essential skills needed to remain competitive learners need to build. The article discusses critical thinking, relationships, asking the right questions, and knowledge application. These are all skills that you will learn in this program.

Let’s pause here so you can **read both articles**. They will help motivate you by knowing just how important this course is for your future success!

## What You Will Learn

**“AiCE will equip you with essential 21st-century workplace skills and teach you how to leverage AI tools for productivity to maximize efficiency in your role.”**

You do not need to be a tech pro to see how AI is rapidly changing the way everything and everyone works. As mentioned by Fred Swaniker in the article you read a few lessons back, just knowing how to do something will soon not be enough to remain relevant in the workplace, regardless of what your job is. **You will need a special blend of workplace skills and AI tools** to stay ahead of the competition and ever-changing work environment.

**Over the next few weeks, you will learn these special skills and how to make the most of many of the best AI tools out there.**

By the end of the program, you will be able to do at least three things:

1. You will have **a clear understanding of how AI is transforming the way people work**, and feel confident about integrating it into various aspects of your daily work routine.

2. You will be able to **apply each of the key workplace skills** that we will teach you during the program, which will make you a better thinker, communicator, and colleague.

3. You will be able to **identify and use common AI tools** that will help you be more productive and maximally efficient at work.

Let’s break down the 8 meta-skills further to understand what each one entails and what you will learn over the next 6 weeks in a little more detail.

## Course Completion Requirements And Policies

### Content, Milestones and Tests

Each week of the program, new learning content is released on Sunday at 11:59 PM GMT. You will need to carefully review the content to successfully complete the Test and the Milestone for that week.

During the 6 weeks of this course, you will have 6 required Weekly Tests and 6 required Weekly Milestones due.

**To graduate from the program, you must complete and submit ALL weekly tests and milestones.**

This means **there is a total of 12 required graded elements over the next 6 weeks of this program.**

- Weekly Tests and Milestones are due **every Sunday of the program by no later than 11:59 pm GMT**.

- The Weekly Test is graded automatically and immediately upon submission.

- The weekly Milestone is a submitted assignment that is peer-graded.

- To pass, you must receive a 75% or higher score on each Test and Milestone.

- Finally, you must report your employment status.

### Peer Review (also called Peer Evaluation/Peer Grading/Peer Assessment)

All milestones, except the final one, require you to complete a peer grading. This means that you are required to grade a peer’s work once you are assigned one.

**You must complete your peer review by each Wednesday following the Milestone due date, no later than 11:59 pm GMT**.

For example, if Milestone 1 is live/open on **Sunday, 10 March, at 11:59 pm GMT**. You Peer review will due by **Wednesday, 20 March, before 11:59 pm GMT**, 3 days after the Milestone deadline. So in short, the following will be a weekly occurrence:

- Milestone goes live on Sunday midnight (start of the week)

- Milestone is due on Sunday midnight (end of the week)

- Peer review of milestone is due on Wednesday midnight (the following week)

To graduate With Honors (to be on the Honor’s List), you have to;
- Complete and pass all weekly deliverables before the deadline

- Report your employment status

**Please read and understand the detailed** [program requirements and policies here](/Program%20Overview/AICE%20C2%20Program%20Brochure.pdf).

## Late Submission Policies

We expect you to make every effort to take the Test and Milestone due dates seriously. This is an intense course, and it is very difficult to catch up if you fall behind. To remain in good standing, you must submit your passing Milestone and Test by the deadline (Sunday at 11:59 pm GMT) **every week**.

That being said, we do recognize that emergencies and unexpected things happen. But don’t worry! We believe in second chances! We will not immediately unenroll you! Let’s walk you through what you need to do if you miss or fail any milestone or test.

1. If you didn’t submit your weekly Milestone by Sunday at 11:59 pm GMT:

You can still submit the Milestone on Savanna past the due date, but this submission will be tagged as “Late” by the system. Milestones 1 - 4 will be open for late submission up until the end of week 4. Since this is already your second chance, you have NO room to fail.

Once you submit your milestone, the system will automatically assign you another learner’s milestone to review and grade. You are required to complete this peer review accurately while offering constructive feedback. Only then will you be considered as having completed your weekly deliverables. If you wrongly fail a peer, you will be penalized and might lose your chance to graduate from AiCE. If you do not grade your peer, you will not graduate from the course.

2. If you didn’t pass your Milestone (if your peer gave you a non-passing score):

*You have 2 options*.

A. If you feel the non-passing score was in error, don’t panic. An ALX grader will review your work. There is no need to alert or send an email before a failed milestone is reviewed again. ALX graders review ALL failed milestones to confirm that the scores given are accurate. Please note the ALX grader’s decision on your score is final and cannot be disputed.

OR

B. After reviewing the comment and score your peer gave you, and you note that, indeed, you did not do well on your milestone, you can simply redo it and submit a fresh, well-done milestone. The good thing is ALX gives you a rubric you can use to self-assess. Take a deep breath, use the rubric to check where to improve and go ahead to resubmit a better milestone. This is a good opportunity for you to take feedback graciously and act upon it (a key attribute employers value).

3. If you didn’t submit your weekly Test by Sunday at 11:59 pm GMT and pass with a score of 75% or higher:

AiCE tests are curated to help you gauge your understanding of the key concepts covered in the syllabus. If you do not do well on a test, you have only three chances to redo it. HOWEVER, 5% will be deducted from your overall score per attempt. That is, the first trial is graded over 100%, the second trial is graded over 95%, and the third trial is graded over 90%.

If you go through all the week’s content, the test will be fairly easy to pass. Do your best to pass with 75% or more on the first try.

Tests 1, 2 and 3 will remain open until the end of Week 4.

NOTE: If you have 2 or more missing and/or failed Tests or Milestones, you will not graduate from the program.
