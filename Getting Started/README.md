## Karibu Ceremony

![image](/Getting%20Started/image/KARIBU!.jpg)

**Need to know everything about this exciting journey before going full throttle? We have you covered.**

We will begin the **Onboarding process on Monday, March 4, 2024**, where you will be introduced to the **ALX Community Portal and Savanna**. These two platforms will be used throughout the course. During the onboarding process, we will provide you with all the necessary information about the program and what you can expect. You will also receive an introduction to the ALX Community, including the core values and mindsets we uphold, as well as some tips to help you succeed in this program. We will also make sure that you know how to navigate and use both **Savanna and the Community Portal**.

The next session you will be attending is the **Deep Dive on How to Thrive on Savanna on Wednesday, March 6, 2024**. In this session, we will take you through the course curriculum, focusing on how to navigate Savanna. We will also dive into the program requirements, highlighting the assignments you will be required to complete each week. You don’t want to miss this session, as it is crucial for your success in the program.

**And, finally, the grand ceremony: The Karibu Ceremony on Saturday, March 9, 2024!**

This is your big welcome to the ALX Community, with a live session accompanied by some fun activities within our ALX Hubs. By now, you should know that ALX has hubs across 8 different cities in Africa, and we encourage you to go visit the city hub near you so you get the opportunity to interact with your peers and the ALX team. If you do not live near an ALX Hub, worry not; we have some fun sessions planned for you online - you will not miss out on anything.

*Attendance of the Karibu ceremony is a program requirement. Plus, it’s always awesome! You don’t want to miss it. So make sure you have all the details you need to attend.*

If you are not able to attend the ceremony in person, please keep an eye on your inbox for further details on how to participate in the ceremony online.

In addition to the Karibu Ceremony and the content here on Savanna, there are a ton of orientation activities taking place throughout this week, online and at your nearest City Hub. **You are expected to participate actively**.

Please take a moment right now to add this AiCE calendar to your own calendar by [clicking on this link](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/uqq4fmkc6D5KbNaWLp3SMg). Make note of what is happening and when so you do not miss any key program events or deadlines.

This is the week to start out right, get set up for success, and understand what is in store. Missing any of the onboarding activities this week will make it extremely difficult for you to succeed in this program. How you start will strongly impact the rest of your journey here at ALX. Trust us, you don’t want to be running like this guy to catch up!


## Your Primary Tools

![image](/Getting%20Started/image/AI.png)

Here are the primary tools you’ll be working with during this course:

1. **Savanna**: This is the learning management system that you’re going to be receiving the content on. This is also the place where you’ll be submitting the tests, assignments and the Milestones.

2. **Community Platform**: This is the primary form of communication between you and the Sand-tech team. This is where you’ll receive all your announcements and be able to reach out to your community ambassadors.

3. **Chat GPT**: This is an AI course after all! A lot of the exercises and tool we share will be using Chat GPT. So if you don’t already have an account, make one. The free plan will be sufficient for the requirements of this course.

4. **Google Workspace**: Our downloadable material is all on Google Apps! And we recommend you use them for your work (Docs, Sheets, Slides etc.) too. A lot of the workplace skills that you’re going to be learning will also use Google Workspace as examples. So if you don’t have a Google account, time to get one!

5. **AI Toolkit**: We’ll be sharing different AI tools and apps that can help you be more efficient, productive and effective. These will build your AI Toolkit. Keep track of these tools as they’re shared and try to start applying them in your professional life!

**To be an effective professional, a consistent and reliable internet connection is a must.**

**This program requires that you have a stable internet connection.** There are many videos to view, a lot of content to absorb, peer activities to complete, live virtual events to attend, and a requirement to upload milestone assignments and evaluate peers’ assignments on time. Please adequately plan ahead for how you are going to accomplish this.

Some students have purchased additional data plans, while others have planned on working from a cafe with Wi-Fi for several hours each day. We understand this can be a challenging problem, but internet connectivity must be constant to thrive in this program and the global workspace.

**We believe in your resourcefulness!** As you go through this program, we encourage you to share with your peers how you plan on implementing creative and reliable solutions to consistent and reliable Wi-Fi!

## Device Requirements

    </tr>
</table>

To thrive in the program, **you need access to a computer.** This can be a good desktop or laptop.

It is almost impossible to do paid work exclusively from a mobile phone. The same is true for this program. **We do not support the course experience on a phone.**

While it’s true that you can access a lot of the course content via your mobile phone, you do need a computer to be able to complete all of the course activities. This becomes especially true when you need to complete your Tests, Milestones, and peer grading.

**TLDR: You will need to use a computer to complete the activities in Savanna and Google Workspace. We do not provide support for issues caused by attempting to take the course on a mobile device.**

**Here are a few reasons why you definitely need a computer to complete this program successfully:**

1. When you are working with Google Workspace on documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, you need a larger screen to see and work skillfully with the large amount of data there.

2. Most Milestones require you to create documents, convert them to .pdf, and upload them to **Savanna**. Converting documents on a phone is challenging, and we cannot guarantee that **Savanna** will successfully and consistently accept documents uploaded from a phone.

3. The Weekly Tests are timed, and the functionality of tests delivered on the phone is poor and sometimes non-functional. Taking a test on your phone can cause you to fail it.

4. Peer grading in **Savanna** is only officially supported on a computer. Attempting to do peer grading on a mobile phone may result in technical glitches or incomplete peer evaluations. This can cause you to fail the Milestone and the course.

The only place where a mobile phone is an ok choice is when using the community messaging platform on The Room Portal.

## Create a Google Account

![image](/Getting%20Started/image/GW.png)

**You will be using Google Workspace tools throughout this course.**

If you don’t already have a Gmail account (which also serves as your Google Workspace account), now is the time to create one.

**Gmail for personal use is free** and allows you to access critical workspace tools including, Google Drive, Sheets, Docs, Slides, Calendar, Forms, and Meet.

You can follow the step-by-step instructions here: [How to create a Google account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en). Again, a personal account is free and should be sufficient for your purposes for now. A business account has more features but costs money each month. You can always upgrade later if you choose to.

![image](/Getting%20Started/image/google.png)

**Wait! We have a few more thoughts before you get started with creating your Gmail account.**

You will likely be using your Gmail to connect with potential employers through emails, file sharing and online meetings, so **think carefully about your username as it forms part of your email address (and personal brand to the outside world)**.

We recommend using your name as your Gmail username. For example, if your name is *Sarati Jonas* then your username should be something like *Sarati.Jonas* or *sjonas*. If those usernames are taken, Gmail will suggest suitable alternatives. Pick one that you won’t be embarrassed to use professionally.

Using nicknames or pet names such as *Sarababy, SJ4life* or *BigMuscles21*, will not demonstrate your professionalism. So think ahead a pick a username that will work well for you in professional settings. It will likely be the first impression you make when connecting with potential employers (or clients) via email.

## Activity: Create Your ALX AiCE Google Drive Folder

Let’s get you set up with a dedicated Google Drive folder for all your ALX AiCE course materials. This folder will be your go-to spot for storing everything from activity sheets to milestone worksheets. Don’t worry if it’s empty at first - it’ll fill up as you progress through the course.

__Create an AiCE folder using these steps:__

__Step 1. Open Google Drive__: If you don’t have it open already, head over to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/).

__Step 2. Create a New Folder__: Click on the **+ New** button on the left side, then select ‘Folder’ from the dropdown menu.

![image](/Getting%20Started/image/drive.png)

__Step 3. Name Your Folder__: Use this format to Name your folder `FirstName_ALX_AiCE_Folder`. This will help you easily identify it later.

For example, a correct folder name is: “`Jojo_ALX_AiCE_Folder`”.

__Step 4. Organize Your Content__: As you complete each week’s activities and worksheets, save them directly into this folder. This keeps all your work in one place and easily accessible.

__Step 5. Keep It Updated__: Make it a habit to regularly check and update this folder. After each activity or lesson, upload your work to ensure nothing gets lost or forgotten.

Once you complete the AiCE program, this folder will be a helpful reference bank for you. It is important that you keep all the materials you use in the course, and this folder allows you to easily review them whenever you need to.
